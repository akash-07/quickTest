### WSR 27-3-18

* We changed our tool to a atom plugin that integrates haskell's hpc and quickCheck to ease testing and debugging in the atom editor.
* Learnt about atom plugin development and explored java Script for plugin development since atom's backend works in java script.
* Started out with the development of small plugin. The code can be found from the latest commit.

**Next Week goals:**
- Explore more on atom api for plugin development.
- Integrate quickCheck.
